"Time," says the proverb, "is money".This means that every moment well-spent may putsome money into our pockets.
lf our time is usefully employed, it will either turn out some useful and important piece ofwork which will fetch its price in the market, or it will add to our experience and increase ourcapacities so as to enable us to earn money when the proper opportunity comes.Let those,who think nothing of wasting time, remember this.
our life is nothing more than our time. To kill time is therefore a form of suicide. We areshocked when we think of death, and we spare no pains, no trouble, and no expense topreserve life.
